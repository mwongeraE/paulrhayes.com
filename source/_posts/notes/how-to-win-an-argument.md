[Philosophize This! #73](http://philosophizethis.org/how-to-win-an-argument-pt-1/) ([Transcript](http://philosophizethis.org/episode-73-transcript/))

Techniques that people use to win their arguments and how to identify them.

Hard to know how to attack an argument if you don't know which part is wrong.

* Find the weak points
* Problem at foundation of argument

Faulty justifications, simplifications used over and over.

## Fallacies

### Argument from consequences

* Argues how true or false something is based on whether they like the consequences of if that thing were true
* If god doesn't exist, there's no moral accountability, therefore I believe god exists. 'I believe that god exists, because if it doesn't, that's just not a world I want to live in'
* Just because someone wants it to be true has no connection with whether it is true
* If X then Y will happen, Y is a good outcome for me, therefore X must be true
* Finding fallacy tricky
* Sometimes an appropriate argument - eg appealing to consequences. Difference: Proposition for making things better rather than what we should believe is true. Consider politician campaigning for change.

### Affirming the consequent

* Just because you know that if something happened a specific consequence would happen, and you live in a world where that consequence is a reality, you can't just assume that that one thing that could have caused it happened
* If cashier won lottery, they would be happy. You go to shop and see they are happy, therefore they won the lottery
* Other explanations for why
* Wrong to use consequence to confirm antecedent
* If someone was going to be a good president they would have seen economic downturn coming. Trump saw it coming, therefore he would make a good president. Argument doesn't prove good or bad.
* If god existed we would be able to see unparalleled beauty in nature, it's all around us, therefore god exists.

### Appeal to ignorance

* We can assume that something is true simply because there is no evidence that it is not true.
* No evidence Bigfoot doesn't exist. Therefore Bigfoot exists
* Cloaked in clever ways
* Bush when running for president. Dan Rather suggesting Bush not honourable in National Guard. Bush response: using forged documents. Now: to dismiss claims, prove documents weren't forged - but how? By the time you do argument gone off rails.
* Hide behind stage of gathering definitive evidence. Use as shield. Know that process will be impossible or exhausting.
* Stalemate often
* Personal incredulity variant: believe because not disproven yet, convenient way to believe what you believe without questioning it.
* Because it's hard to understand they assume it must not be true.
* What someone feels should be possible is baseless.
* Judging what's possible in a field of expertise they have no knowledge of.

### Slippery slope fallacy

* Make case that a position is bad because acceptance of it would bring about a sequence of events that would be horrible
* Sidestep discussion, conclude that this thing you're discussing will lead to this horrible outcome, then ask the person you're arguing with to defend the horrible outcome

### Straw man fallacy

* When winning
* Takes argument and paints simplified version of argument for easy target to attack
* I believe in God, what you believe there's some old guy with a beard on the sky watching over all of us?
* I think we shouldn't spend 600bn on military spending. Straw man back: I can't believe you'd want to leave the country defenceless.
* Mischaracterising an idea, making a worse argument, easier to refute, easier than understanding original argument

### Ad hominem argument

* Attack personally in attempt to discredit source of information
* When winning
* I don't think it's a good idea to throw cats off buildings - oh yeah, coming from someone who's never had a cat before?
* Knee jerk response
* Diversion
* Discredit source then don't have to look at beliefs honestly
* Pretend words I had said were said by someone you respect

### False equivalence

* Common in media
* Goal to use one or two attributes to use to pretend as though both things are the same
* Both cats and dogs fluffy, so they are the same
* Some scientists have done experiments to say humans    are causing climate change, some say they aren't. Guess it's a stalemate.
* Just because both sides have done studies does not mean they are both done legimitiately, honestly, number of studies, sample sizes

### Appeal to bandwagon

* Because majority believe in something then it must be true
* Commercials
* 100s of people happy because they use X
* Millions used to believe earth was flat. Millions now believe it's not flat, that's not what makes it true.
