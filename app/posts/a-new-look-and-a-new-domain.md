It’s been almost a year since my last post. In that time I’ve moved house, changed jobs and got married, it’s been a bit of a whirlwind. And the web has moved fast as well, CSS and canvas experiments have been popping up all over the place (see [del.icio.us/fofr/css3](https://del.icio.us/fofr/css3) for my favourites).

Inevitably coming back to ‘FofR Online’ after such a long period I wasn’t happy with the site, and I’ve committed the web faux pas of changing the design and the domain name at the same time. I’ve dropped the rather meaningless pseudonym in favour of using my name as a brand. All pages now redirect to paulrhayes.com.

This site is my first experiment with TypeKit and web fonts. I’ve chosen to use Museo for headers and Swing dancer for my name. I can’t say I’m entirely happy, but if I waited for that I’d never release anything.
