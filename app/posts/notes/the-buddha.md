## #9 The Buddha

* Life of Buddha
* How Buddha came to four noble truths

## Four noble truths

### 1. The nature of suffering

* Suffering is universal
* Dissatisfaction is the default state of the human brain
* Satisfaction, or happiness, leaves as often as it comes
* No matter what: It eventually fades (eg buying your dream car)
* No matter how good something is, eventually it just becomes normal
* You no longer fully appreciate what you have

### 2. The cause of suffering

* Desire (created by mind in different ways)
* Attachment, aversion or ignorance
* Attachment
  * See something they want, assume having that thing makes them happy
  * Exalt the good properties, ignore bad things
* Aversion
  * Magnifies problems into things bigger than they are
  * Agonises over things they have no control over
  * Cut in line example, some people fuming, anger to be expected, "if only I didn't have to deal with…"
  * Someone from a different set of experiences having same things happen to them may not feel slighted
  * Expectations: Expected to be treated in a certain way. Why is not meeting those personal expectations bad.
* Ignorance
  * From attachment and aversion – your individual happiness depends on and is controlled by the world around you
  * "If only X hadn't happened…"
  * No good things or bad things, just things (examples of _bad_ things leading to _good_ things)
  * Things, people, places, situations – none have inherent characteristics, we just think they do
* Ineffective ways of pursuing happiness, destined to fail

### 3. How suffering can be eliminated

* Suffering can be ended by eliminating desire
* Desire comes from selfishness
* Delusion that _you_ exist separately from everyone else
* We are all part of a giant internal structure of existence that's interconnected
* Ego
* Be mindful of what's productive

### 4. The path to remove suffering altogether

* Get rid of your ego
* Roadmap to Nirvana - the 8-fold path, perfect it to achieve enlightenment
* Morality: Right speech, right action, right livelihood
* Meditation: Right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration
* Wisdom: Right understanding, right resolve
* Interpretations vary enormously
* Easier said than done

## Buddhism

* Mental gymnastics
* No God beholden to
* Fate in own hands
* Buddha significance is example of reaching Nirvana, something to emulate
* Encouraged discourse and discussion
* Meditation and mindfulness
* Ego: A person always in your face, yammering on about "you!", from birth to death, on and on – non-stop internal chatter.
  * Try to think about one thing
  * Surprising how easy to fail
* Mindfulness is about monitoring thoughts to determine if productive, eventually decrease bad
