Last week WebKit included the much anticipated (at least on my part) 3D transforms in its latest nightly build, announced practically alongside the awesome [Snow Stack demo](http://www.satine.org/research/webkit/snowleopard/snowstack.html) that provides a 3D interface for browsing Flickr images (use left, right and space-bar). Today the [Surfin Safari blog](https://webkit.org/blog/386/3d-transforms/) has updated with some more exciting demos, including _Morphin Power Cubes_ and _Poster Circle_. It is now possible to create all sorts of crazy three-dimensional and animated user interfaces; the power comes largely in `-webkit-perspective` and a number of updated transforms — adapted to incorporate the Z axis.

Since working on the [3D cube using 2D transforms](/2009-04/3d-cube-using-css-transformations/) back in April I’ve experimented with perspective to create something more powerful, playing around with 3D transforms on the iPhone a few times (eg this [early rotating demo](/experiments/perspective/)). Now I’ve got something worth sharing.

A 3D cube can be created solely in CSS, with all six faces. Using JavaScript to detect key presses and update inline styles this cube can be intuitively navigated.

## Result

Supported browsers: WebKit Nightly r46042+

<time datetime="2010-09-28">28 Sept 2010</time>: [Cube updated](/2010-09/3d-css-cube-ii-touch-gestures-click-and-drag/) to work with touch gestures and click and drag</a>

<time datetime="2012-02-12">12 Feb 2012</time>: Experiment updated. 3D transforms are now supported in Safari, Chrome and Firefox 10\. Although the perspective appears off, probably due to a [perspective-origin bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=726397).

## How To

I’ll start with the markup, because it’s simple. Each of the six cube faces is given a face class and another relating to it’s number. These six faces sit within a cube container, which sits in another wrapper, each is necessary.

```html
<div id="experiment">
  <div id="cube">
    <div class="face one">
      One face
    </div>
    <div class="face two">
      Up, down, left, right
    </div>
    <div class="face three">
      Lorem ipsum.
    </div>
    <div class="face four">
      New forms of navigation are fun.
    </div>
    <div class="face five">
      Rotating 3D cube
    </div>
    <div class="face six">
      More content
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

The outer wrapper serves as a camera, on which you apply some perspective — appropriate 3D transformations are then applied to descendants. `-webkit-perspective` defines the depth of the Z-plane and relative sizes of elements above and below it, `-webkit-perspective-origin` specifies the perspective’s origin. [View a perspective example (webkit.org)](https://webkit.org/blog-files/3d-transforms/perspective-by-example.html)

```css
#experiment {
  -webkit-perspective: 800px;
  -webkit-perspective-origin: 50% 200px;
}
```

The second container, the actual cube, has a specified height, margin, position, etc. as usual. The height and width are necessary to create some confines for the cube face transformations — alternatively the width defaults to 100% and the cube’s appearance would vary with window width. `-webkit-transition` ([documentation](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transitions/)) defines the animated property, duration and timing-function — we’re animating the 3d transformation (via `-webkit-transform`) linearly for two seconds. `-webkit-transform-style` determines whether child elements lie flat against their parent (`flat`) or remain in 3D space (`preserve-3d`).

```css
#cube {
  position: relative;
  margin: 0 auto;
  height: 400px;
  width: 400px;
  -webkit-transition: -webkit-transform 2s linear;
  -webkit-transform-style: preserve-3d;
}
```

Using the `.face` class common styles are applied to the six sides; colouring, size, padding, etc. Importantly they are each positioned absolutely, relative to the cube container. The background `rgba` property is included to make the cube look pretty and transparent.

```css
.face {
  position: absolute;
  height: 360px;
  width: 360px;
  padding: 20px;
  background-color: rgba(50, 50, 50, 0.7);
}
```

Each of the faces, one through six, needs to be rotated in 3D space to its correct starting position. Using `translateZ` the elements are brought 200px (half their width) off the Z-plane. Each of the faces must be at 90 degrees. Rotating solely in the X plane positions the top and bottom faces (one, six), before rotating the last four faces in the Y plane, much like origami. The extra rotate on the sixth face rotates the content in 2D space to correct its orientation.

```css
#cube .one  {
  -webkit-transform: rotateX(90deg) translateZ(200px);
}

#cube .two {
  -webkit-transform: translateZ(200px);
}

#cube .three {
  -webkit-transform: rotateY(90deg) translateZ(200px);
}

#cube .four {
  -webkit-transform: rotateY(180deg) translateZ(200px);
}

#cube .five {
  -webkit-transform: rotateY(-90deg) translateZ(200px);
}

#cube .six {
  -webkit-transform: rotateX(-90deg) translateZ(200px) rotate(180deg);
}
```

Our cube is now complete — but it doesn’t move! With a keydown event listener we can increment X and Y angles based on different key presses, before applying them as inline styles on the cube container. In combination with the transition effect on `#cube`, all six faces rotate in sync from their original position to the newly defined angle, creating a seamless 3D cube interface.

```js
var xAngle = 0, yAngle = 0;
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(e) {
  switch(e.keyCode) {

    case 37: // left
      yAngle -= 90;
      break;

    case 38: // up
      xAngle += 90;
      break;

    case 39: // right
      yAngle += 90;
      break;

    case 40: // down
      xAngle -= 90;
      break;
  };

  $('cube').style.webkitTransform = "rotateX("+xAngle+"deg) rotateY("+yAngle+"deg)";
}, false);
```
