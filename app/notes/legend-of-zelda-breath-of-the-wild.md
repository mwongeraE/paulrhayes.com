* Accidentally catching fish with a bomb
* Chopping down a tree to make a bridge
* Gliding and climbing
* Riding my first horse
* Seeing my first fox
* Bumping a bear in the forest
* Picking up a skeleton head and kicking it off a cliff
* Seeing a double rainbow
* Seeing the northern lights
* Chasing a falling star
* Stumbling on my first dragon
* Trying to photograph lightning
* Standing in the rain
* Completing a shrine in a way that's different to what's intended
* Trees that are different from each other
* Finding durian
* Being chased by wolves on a mountain for the first time
* Pulling out the master sword
* Stopping time and attacking an enemy
* Using Daruk’s protection to kill guardians
* Posing at the top of Hyrule Castle’s spire
* Watching Link glide down as Ganon rises from the floor for the final battle
* A flash of the triforce
* Silent princess flower at the end
